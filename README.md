This is a short demo on how to use the TRACMIP data on the pangeo cloud. TRACMIP is a public dataset of 
global climate model simulations in idealized setup to study tropical rainfall and other phenomena. It is 
documented in Voigt et al., 2016, JAMES, https://doi.org/10.1002/2016MS000748. Note that besides pangeo, TRACMIP is also available via ESGF 
(which also holds the CMIP data), yet this would require a different data access.
